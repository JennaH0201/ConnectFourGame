# üéÆ ConnectFour Framework ‚Äì IFN584 Group Project

Welcome to **ConnectFour**, a modular and extensible implementation of the classic two-player strategy game ‚Äî developed by Team 14 for **IFN584: Software Development** at QUT.

This project demonstrates clean architecture, strategic object-oriented design, and robust gameplay mechanics, all delivered through a user-friendly C# console interface.

## üß† Project Overview

**ConnectFour** is a turn-based board game where players drop discs into a grid, aiming to connect four of their own symbols in a row ‚Äî vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

Our framework supports multiple game variants and modes, showcasing:

- Extensible architecture for future board games
- Special disc types with unique effects
- Human vs Human and Human vs Computer gameplay
- Undo/Redo, Save/Restore, and Spin mechanics
- Design pattern integration for maintainability and scalability

## Project Configuration Files

This project includes two important configuration files to support development in **Visual Studio** and ensure smooth cross-platform compatibility:

### `.gitignore`

- **Purpose**: Hides files that are not relevant to the project (e.g. build artifacts, user-specific settings, temporary files).
- **Why it matters**: Keeps the repository clean and avoids cluttering version control with IDE-generated files.
- **Visual Studio users**: Prevents `.vs/`, `.user`, `.suo`, and other IDE-specific files from being tracked.
- **Cross-platform**: Ensures macOS and Windows users don‚Äôt commit OS-specific temp files.

### `.gitattributes`

- **Purpose**: Normalizes line endings and sets file handling rules across platforms.
- **Why it matters**: Prevents issues when switching between Windows (CRLF) and macOS/Linux (LF).
- **Visual Studio users**: Ensures consistent behavior when cloning or merging code.
- **Cross-platform**: Helps avoid merge conflicts due to line-ending differences.
