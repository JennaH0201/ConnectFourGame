# üéÆ ConnectFour Framework ‚Äì IFN584 Group Project

Welcome to **ConnectFour**, a modular and extensible implementation of the classic two-player strategy game ‚Äî developed by Team 14 for **IFN584: Software Development** at QUT.


---

## üß† Project Overview

**ConnectFour** is a turn-based board game where players drop discs into a grid, aiming to connect four of their own symbols in a row ‚Äî vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

## üß† Design Patterns in Code

This project applies several object-oriented design patterns to improve modularity, extensibility, and maintainability. The table below highlights where each pattern is implemented in the codebase.

| Design Pattern     | Location in Code                          | Status | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Template Method     | `GameBase.cs` ‚Äì `PlayGame()` method       | ‚úÖ     | Base class defines game loop; subclasses override game-specific steps       |
| Factory Method      | `DiscFactory.cs` ‚Äì `CreateDiscFromSymbol()` | ‚úÖ     | Returns correct disc type (Ordinary, Boring, Magnetic) based on symbol      |
| Strategy            | `IMoveStrategy.cs` ‚Äì interface definition<br>`RandomStrategy.cs`, `WinningMoveStrategy.cs` | ‚úÖ     | AI player uses strategy interface to choose moves                           |
| Command             | `ICommand.cs` ‚Äì interface<br>`PlaceDiscCommand.cs`, `UndoCommand.cs`, `RedoCommand.cs` | ‚úÖ     | Each move is stored as a command; supports undo/redo stack                  |
| Composite           | `Grid.cs` and `Cell.cs` ‚Äì grid composed of cells | ‚ùå     | Intended to treat grid and cells uniformly via shared interface             |
| Observer            | `IGameObserver.cs`, `ConsoleLogger.cs`    | ‚ùå     | Intended to notify observers on game state changes                          |

## Project Configuration Files

This project includes two important configuration files to support development in **Visual Studio** and ensure smooth cross-platform compatibility:

### `.gitignore`

- **Purpose**: Hides files that are not relevant to the project (e.g. build artifacts, user-specific settings, temporary files).
- **Why it matters**: Keeps the repository clean and avoids cluttering version control with IDE-generated files.
- **Visual Studio users**: Prevents `.vs/`, `.user`, `.suo`, and other IDE-specific files from being tracked.
- **Cross-platform**: Ensures macOS and Windows users don‚Äôt commit OS-specific temp files.

### `.gitattributes`

- **Purpose**: Normalizes line endings and sets file handling rules across platforms.
- **Why it matters**: Prevents issues when switching between Windows (CRLF) and macOS/Linux (LF).
- **Visual Studio users**: Ensures consistent behavior when cloning or merging code.
- **Cross-platform**: Helps avoid merge conflicts due to line-ending differences.
